        <!-- Individual Q&A Block 1 -->
        <div class="qanda-block">
          <p class="qanda-question">Why did you choose your profession?</p>
          <p class="qanda-answer"> I chose IT as my profession because I was fascinated by how computers worked. Starting at the age of 12, I was programming and learning to break encryption on games, finding it more rewarding to see how they worked than playing them. This opened a career path in computers where I could continuously learn and solve complex challenges. </p>
        </div>
        <!-- Individual Q&A Block 2 -->
        <div class="qanda-block">
          <p class="qanda-question">What has been the greatest accomplishment of your life so far?<br>
            Is there anything you wish to do even better?</p>
          <p class="qanda-answer"> The most significant accomplishment of my life so far has been cultivating a meaningful sense of gratitude through one of the lessons I've learned. My dad suffered a stroke when I was a teenager. The deep physical and emotional toll on my dad and the rest of our family, and his death a few years later, left a significant mark on our lives. Through the grief and questions of why this would happen to us, we slowly healed and gained a deep and lasting empathy for others and a profound thankfulness for the time we had with him and his meaning in our lives. I've come to appreciate the importance of family, friends, and finding purpose in life. I will always aspire to remember this invaluable lesson and continue to navigate life with grace, humility, and purpose. </p>
        </div>
        <!-- Individual Q&A Block 3 -->
        <div class="qanda-block">
          <p class="qanda-question">How would your peers and team members describe your responsiveness as a leader?</p>
          <p class="qanda-answer"> During my time as an infantry soldier, I learned valuable principles that heavily influenced me as both a strategic and servant leader. One of the most important values instilled in me was the significance of empowering team members and fostering their growth, both individually and as a cohesive unit. We were taught to acknowledge our own strengths and weaknesses, and how to improve upon them. This was based on a pragmatic approach that emphasized the importance of engendering true loyalty by involving soldiers in the plan and solution, empowering them to play their part in the mission's success. <br>
            <br>
            This is like the leadership approach illustrated by the fictional character, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lasso" target="_blank">Ted Lasso</a>. Ted acknowledges his limitations and actively works towards improvement. He builds a culture of collaboration, trust, and support while coaching and mentoring his teammates to reach their full potential. He knows that if each team member is genuinely empowered, the team will find greatness. <br>
            <br>
            Positive feedback from my peers and team members reflects these strategic leadership qualities. They often describe me as responsive and forward-thinking—a leader who not only addresses immediate concerns but also guides the team toward long-term objectives. By cultivating an environment where everyone is engaged in the strategic vision, I continue to grow on my leadership journey, helping the team navigate challenges and adapt to changing circumstances. </p>

            <p class="testimonial-quote">“As the Network Services Government lead, I have worked in the IT field for about 15 years and Tim Gabaree has been one of the most talented and knowledgeable Network Engineers that I have worked with. Constantly forward-thinking and anticipating new Network Infrastructure capabilities, Tim always tried to ensure that our organization was leaning on the cutting edge of technology. It was hard considering the federal government's budget constraints. Tim was sought out as the individual for all things IT. Even when it did not pertain to the Network environment, every IT professional in the organization sought out Tim's expertise and knowledge base. Tim helped the organization save countless resources and man-hours, even after he had moved on from the organization. 
              Tim is a great leader that works to ensure his team is provided with the best training and hands-on experience, empowering his staff/team to make the best decisions in planning, developing, implementing, monitoring, and maintaining the Network. As a dedicated leader, Tim encourages his team to always grow educationally and professionally and puts them in positions to take on leadership roles in the organization or at outside organizations.”</p>

            <p class="testimonial-quote">“I have worked with some amazing people over my career and Tim is truly one of the most ingenious. His knowledge and management across all IT platforms is a recipe for success and business evolution. His leadership at the DOJ has empowered those around him directly, as well indirectly across the organizations. Tim has my utmost respect and recommendation to direct and lead any business to what I know would be an immediate increase of prosperity and overall success.”</p>

            <p class="testimonial-quote">“Working with Tim is an experience I would recommend to anyone looking for a professional and a great leader. Tim is driven to understand all aspects of a problem and works though all potential solutions to find the correct and most effective resolution, without introducing any other potential problems. His dedication to delivering high quality, high fidelity solutions, and deep knowledge transfer makes interacting with him a very enjoyable experience.
              
              Tim takes the time to also mentor and encourage others to grow and expand their breath of knowledge. Not only was I a recipient of Tim's encouragement and mentoring, I saw others on the teams we worked with lifted to places that were not even in their planned career path. This ability, to see in others, potential and abilities; makes Tim a strategic leader in many ways. Tim seeks out to enrich everyone's lives in ways not limited to employment, but in full life experiences. Tim shares his passion for many things either related to work, or personal growth to others without hesitation. 
              
              Tim was never afraid to speak up or jump in to keep a process or project moving. His tireless enthusiasm for problem solving helped us find many solutions to direct impacts to our operations when others had thrown in the towel. A good example of this was a twenty six hour day we put in together. Others told us that the solution we were trying to put in place would never work. Tim kept us moving and we delivered on our promise to have the work completed, the improvement was an immediately noticeable positive improvement to our clients.
              
              There are many examples of Tim taking the initiative to deliver or help others deliver tangible results to clients, the above stuck out the most in my mind as that cemented in my mind that if I ever had the opportunity to work with Tim on a project that we would be delivering nothing short of success. 
              
              Tim has a broad base of knowledge not commonly found in others. And when it comes to IT; from the facility to the cloud, there isn't an aspect of the technology Tim doesn't understand or know how to leverage into a complete success.”</p>

            <p class="testimonial-quote">“Throughout my career, I've had the pleasure of working with a select few who excel at leading their teams with a passion for IT knowledge and solving numerous technical issues. One such individual is Tim, who stands out for his impressive research skills in new technology trends and his ability to adapt quickly. His contributions to the network modernization of the DoJ have been invaluable. I highly recommend Tim for any organization looking to improve their efficiency and security through innovative technologies.”</p>

            <p class="testimonial-quote">“As a Direct Report to Tim, I appreciated his direction and management. He garnered much respect from the team as he took on the challenges of the Director of Network Services. Personally, I appreciated the technical and managerial skills he challenged me to master under his tutelage.
              Tim guided our Project Engineering Team though the busiest site refresh season in our company’s history. His organizational skill and adaptability kept projects on schedule while making sure we were capitalizing all our efforts to grow the bottom line. The end result is that we are finishing out the refresh installation season strong. I learned a lot from Tim; he really took care of his employees, was genuinely concerned with work life balance but always was focused on getting the job done!”</p>

            <p class="testimonial-quote">“Tim Gabarée is the ultimate leader and team builder. He gets to know each of his teammates to be sure he knows their knowledge sets, goals and aspirations to ensure he can facilitate their careers and fully utilize them within the company, openly encouraging conversations that show he cares about the person, maintaining 100% retention while upping performance within his authority, whether scoped or matrixed. He extends himself to go in search and fight for excellent training opportunities that not only serve each teammate to the best extent possible, but they also better serve the future of the company and ensure 'Mission First' remains paramount. Tim provides vision, mentors and trains his employees constantly, sharing knowledge so that nothing is one person deep and communication up and down the organization is fully open. His leadership has produced valued leaders and only continues on this path. Tim's natural and learned leadership abilities demonstrate his understanding of bottom up/top down management and how important it is to care and cultivate the talent one already has on the team. Everyone wants to be on his team because they are treated well and valued. And their careers are developed with the kind of care that someone would do for themselves. This is also reflected in their loyalty to the company. 
              
              Tim's work ethic is incredible. He will work tirelessly and with a phenomenal attitude, encouraging and leading others at any time of day or night, until the mission is complete. His approach to his work is always the same--with a fantastic attitude, with no less than an optimal solution acceptable. He won't settle, but instead finds innovative, long term solutions. If the job is not done, he is not done.
              
              Between work ethic, leader and innovator, you cannot find a more dynamic, better communicator or overall employee to manage and lead your workforce and company's direction into the future.”</p>
