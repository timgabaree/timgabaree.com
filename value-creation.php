                <p>
                    Technology value is not created by spending more or modernizing
                    everything. It comes from understanding where technology
                    materially improves the organization and making deliberate
                    choices about where to invest, simplify, standardize, or stop.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That means looking beyond project delivery to operating cost,
                    service performance, vendor economics, risk, architecture, and
                    the organization's ability to sustain the change after the
                    implementation is complete.
