  <div class="qandaClass"> 
    <!-- Individual Q&A Blocks -->
    <div class="qandaBlock">
      <p class="qandaQuestion">Why did you choose your profession?</p>
      <p class="qandaAnswer"> I chose IT as my profession because I was fascinated by how computers worked. Starting at the age of 12, I was programming and learning to break encryption on games, finding it more rewarding to see how they worked than playing them. This opened a career path in computers where I could continuously learn and solve complex challenges. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="qandaBlock">
      <p class="qandaQuestion">What has been the greatest accomplishment of your life so far?<br>
        Is there anything you wish to do even better?</p>
      <p class="qandaAnswer"> The most significant accomplishment of my life so far has been cultivating a meaningful sense of gratitude through one of the lessons I've learned. My dad suffered a stroke when I was a teenager. The deep physical and emotional toll on my dad and the rest of our family, and his death a few years later, left a significant mark on our lives. Through the grief and questions of why this would happen to us, we slowly healed and gained a deep and lasting empathy for others and a profound thankfulness for the time we had with him and his meaning in our lives. I've come to appreciate the importance of family, friends, and finding purpose in life. I will always aspire to remember this invaluable lesson and continue to navigate life with grace, humility, and purpose. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="qandaBlock">
      <p class="qandaQuestion">How would your peers and team members describe your responsiveness as a leader?</p>
      <p class="qandaAnswer"> During my time as an infantry soldier, I learned valuable principles that heavily influenced me as both a strategic and servant leader. One of the most important values instilled in me was the significance of empowering team members and fostering their growth, both individually and as a cohesive unit. We were taught to acknowledge our own strengths and weaknesses, and how to improve upon them. This was based on a pragmatic approach that emphasized the importance of engendering true loyalty by involving soldiers in the plan and solution, empowering them to play their part in the mission's success. <br>
        <br>
        This is like the leadership approach illustrated by the fictional character, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lasso" target="_blank">Ted Lasso</a>. Ted acknowledges his limitations and actively works towards improvement. He builds a culture of collaboration, trust, and support while coaching and mentoring his teammates to reach their full potential. He knows that if each team member is genuinely empowered, the team will find greatness. <br>
        <br>
        Positive feedback from my peers and team members reflects these strategic leadership qualities. They often describe me as responsive and forward-thinking—a leader who not only addresses immediate concerns but also guides the team toward long-term objectives. By cultivating an environment where everyone is engaged in the strategic vision, I continue to grow on my leadership journey, helping the team navigate challenges and adapt to changing circumstances. </p>
